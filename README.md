This app is a project aided and taught by Tutsgalaxy's React Fullstack Course (2018)

- Startup console commands

  - npm start to initialize the app
  - npm run serv (runs "json-server --watch db.json --port 3004")

* File structure

  Previous works were known to be disorganized; let's avoid that.

  - src
    - Components (views/widgets/HOC)
      - Component
        - Component.js
        - Component.module.css

Todo:

- ComponentDidMount instead of ComponentWillMount advocated, do some research into why

- VideosRelated links broken

- stateToHTML(convertedContent) in Dashboard.js makes a somewhat unscrutible error on input to the textarea
